# Webbio code challange
My basic thoughts on how I solved the assignment... ...I just fixed it! ... <br/>

* `How i started the project`: ...I started this project with a fairly empty boilerplate from material-ui and combined it with a express boilerplate. <br/> 
* `Great-circle distance`: In how I solved the question regarding the `Great-circle distance` I searched for a module that does the calculating for me for 2 reasons. One is that I must admit that I really don't understand the mathematics and second is that I wouldn't want to reinvent the wheel. In the end if you would've asked me not to use a module I would just honestly copy paste it from somewhere else. 
* `Material-ui`: I have chosen to go this way regarding the frontend of the application because this makes it way more prettier then I would be able to do myself within the time I put into this.
